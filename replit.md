# RapidAPI Lead Miner - Professional Lead Generation Platform

## Overview

RapidAPI Lead Miner is a full-stack web application designed for professional lead generation using multiple RapidAPI services. The application allows users to search for company contacts, scrape data from various sources, and export leads in multiple formats. It's built as a modern React frontend with an Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and bundling

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session storage
- **External APIs**: RapidAPI service integrations for lead generation

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema updates
- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses four main tables:
- **api_configurations**: Stores API service configurations and usage tracking
- **leads**: Stores contact information with enriched data from multiple sources
- **searches**: Tracks search operations and their performance metrics
- **export_history**: Maintains audit trail of data exports

### API Integration Layer
- **RapidAPI Service**: Centralized service for managing multiple RapidAPI endpoints
- **Apollo Scraper**: Specialized for Apollo.io profile URLs and direct email extraction
- **Apollo IO API**: Advanced search with filters for people within companies  
- **Contact Scraper**: Search by domain, website URL, or company name for direct contacts
- **Smart API Routing**: Intelligent selection based on query type and content analysis

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main interface with search capabilities and results display
- **Search Interface**: Tabbed interface supporting single search and bulk CSV upload
- **API Source Control**: Granular selection of specific APIs with visual indicators
- **CSV Upload System**: Automatic domain column detection and bulk processing
- **Results Table**: Paginated table with lead data and export functionality
- **Analytics Cards**: Real-time metrics and usage statistics
- **API Management**: Enhanced configuration panel with usage tracking and status monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **Search Initiation**: User submits single search query or uploads CSV file with domains
2. **CSV Processing**: Automatic detection of domain columns (domain, website, url, site)
3. **API Orchestration**: Backend determines optimal search strategy and calls appropriate RapidAPI services
4. **Bulk Processing**: For CSV uploads, sequential domain processing with progress tracking
5. **Data Processing**: Raw API responses are normalized and stored in the database
6. **Real-time Updates**: Frontend receives search results via API polling
7. **Export Functionality**: Users can export filtered results in CSV or JSON formats

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **ORM**: drizzle-orm and drizzle-zod for database operations
- **HTTP Client**: axios for external API requests
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive Radix UI component library
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form with Zod validation

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Vite**: Modern build tool with HMR and optimized bundling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with autoprefixer

### External Services
- **RapidAPI Platform**: Multiple lead generation APIs
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment with runtime error handling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express.js backend
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error modal for development debugging

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Static assets built via Vite and served from Express
- **Backend**: Node.js application with bundled dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variables
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate configs for development and production

### Environment Variables
- `RAPIDAPI_KEY`: Authentication for RapidAPI services (required for production)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Deployment Configuration
- **GitHub Ready**: Complete repository setup with .gitignore and documentation
- **Vercel Ready**: Configured with vercel.json for seamless deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Stored securely in Vercel dashboard
- **Build Process**: Automatic builds on Git push
- **Static Assets**: Optimized for CDN delivery
- **Documentation**: Complete README.md and DEPLOYMENT.md guides
